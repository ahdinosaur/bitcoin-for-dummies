<p>Bitcoins are controlled by a consentual computational contest called mining.</p>
<p>People dedicate their computer&#39;s power to the network to generate hard-to-find and easy-to-prove numbers, whoever finds the number first attaches new transactions (a <strong>block</strong>) to the public ledger (the <strong>blockchain</strong>).</p>
<p>Once someone finds a number, if the number is valid, everyone starts working on the next number.</p>
<p>Each number should take an estimated 10 minutes to find.</p>
