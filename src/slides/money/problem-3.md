# Problem #3

Making a payment today requires trusting a 3rd party.

- bank
- credit union
- credit card company
- ...

These 3rd parties mediate disputes through reversible transactions (chargebacks).

- increases costs and limits minimum transaction size
- with possiblity of transaction reversal, need for trust spreads
