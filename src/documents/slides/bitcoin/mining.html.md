# Mining

**Mining** is the process by which new transactions are added to the Blockchain (global ledger).

this process of **adding a block of transactions to the blockchain** happens roughly every 10 minutes.

only if the new transactions are honest and abide by the Bitcoin protocol are they accepted by the rest of the network.
