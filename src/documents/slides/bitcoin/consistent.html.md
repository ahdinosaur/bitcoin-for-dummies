# consistent

bitcoins are created by a consentual computational contest called mining.

people dedicate their computer's power to the network to generate hard-to-find and easy-to-prove numbers, whoever finds the number first attaches new transactions (a **block**) to the public ledger (the **blockchain**).

once someone finds a number, if the number is valid, everyone starts working on the next number.

each number should take an estimated 10 minutes to find.
