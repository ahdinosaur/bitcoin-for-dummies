# problem #3

making a payment today requires trusting a 3rd party

- bank
- credit union
- credit card company
- ...

these 3rd parties mediate disputes through reversible transactions (chargebacks)

- increases costs and limits minimum transaction size
- with possiblity of transaction reversal, need for trust spreads
